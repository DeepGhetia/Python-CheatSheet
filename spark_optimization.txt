1. shuffle is most costly operation hence avoid wide operation or get the data to that stage where data is less hence little shuffle.
there are types of optimization - 
    1. code level
        - use cache
        - use reducebykey over groupbykey
        - use broadcast var over join for dimenasion tables
        - select vs wothcolumn for more columns
    2. cluster level (executors) -
