#always remember when ever we wanto replace multiple things in string or list or any thing alsways go fro s.replace()
# alwasy remember strings are immutable please do not forget this
#always remember when you see a problem of time challenge then try to iterate from behind basd on problem Ex- 1903

1. import string

    s = 'String! With. Punctuation?'
    for i in string.punctuation:
        s = s.replace(i,'')
    print(s)

2.   note here that any function in string doesnt update the same string they return new one.

    | Method         | Capitalizes                           | Lowercases        | Multi-word Handling |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
    | `capitalize()` | Only first character of entire string | Rest of string    | No                  |
    | `title()`      | First letter of each word             | Rest of each word | Yes                 |

3. keep in mind always try to create new string whenever possible.
4. string ke andar list use karna is not mandatory u can go for generator's.
5. replace func is the boon in string.
6. these tpe of questions increase confidence - 

import string
s = 'Python'
dic = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase, start=1)}
lt = []
for i in s.lower():
    if i in dic:
        lt.append(dic[i])
print(lt)

#s.split(' ')
there one space refers to remove this one string and count the rest in the complete string

#formatted multiple string inside a single {} ka hack - 
    s = 'deep'
    s1 = 'ghetia'
    print(f'{s+'-'+s1}')

using \n \t is often helpful during writing contents in fies. escape chars
