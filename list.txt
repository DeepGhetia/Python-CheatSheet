***never forget string, list, dic, set, tup all are iterators.***

*** alwasy remeber unpacking can only happen when we are trying to fetch two differnt types of ele 
        ex:- lt = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
                for i,j,k in lt this is not unpacking as all ele in lt are at same level
             but for (i,j),k in [[[1,2],3],[[4,5],6],[[7,8],9]] but here it is, as one is iterable and other is not a iterable

*** one good advice is say you have 2 iterators and you want to iterate both but want a single value then all()/any() is very helpfull.
*** similart to string 'deep'*3 = deepdeepdeep like wise [2]*3 = [2,2,2] jaise string is one but deep repeats 3 times similarly lt is one but 2 repeats 3 times.
*** list is dynamic len changes dynamically based on ele inserted/deletded.
on replacing when replace with single values the replaced item is a list 
on replacing the sliced list the items get unpacked.

*** always remember in list whenever we use INSERT(pos,value) sataement in list then it will replcae the existing value and move the current value 
    to next position but when we use lt[1] = 5 i.e. replacing the existing value only when list is existing it will just replace the
    current value.
*** also lt[0] = 5 is only possible when the list is already existing if not use lt.append/lt.extend

***new normal -
always try not to use list when converting an iterable to any type
example use zip to convert the elements directly of type tuple to dict with list(zip(x,y))

new thing to note is
lt.append(i) always single ele be it int or list or anything
lt.extend(i) always indivial elements from any iterable like ex:- [1,2] is iter hence 1 and 2 are added at the end individual in single step.
also note extend method only takes iterable only.

imp note:-
1. merginig two list - lt1 + lt2
2. merging two dict - {i:j for a in [dic,dic1] for i,j in a.items()}
3. merging two tup - tup + tup1
4 merging two set - {j for i in [s,s1] for j in i}
5. while unpacking when *var is used the output will always be a list no matter what type of ds it is.

four thigns to remeber in list -
1. when going for consecutive iteration go for last ele - 1 check list.py
2. when goin for split the list in equal len go for split with step logic easy or go for list slicing rotation prob (eg)
3. when dealing with index problem always go for enum or range(len(lt))
4. for swapping that is rotation problem always go for split or slicing logic.

when using 
1. count/freq/duplicates use dict - also keep in mind count mthod is list is also useful
2. common - set
2. del list is also imp.  //del lt or del lt[i]
3. merge - union, intersection, difference, issubset
4. max() can also have max(map(sum,lt)) , max(lt,key=sum), max(lt,key=len), max(lt, key=lt.count)
5. 2d list cannot be directly used as dict keys always note convert to tuple first
6. list tuple, dict set imp
7. not in, in imp ***not is very imp***
8. all() and any() imp 
9. string imp
10. isinstance(lt,list) - single,  isinstance('a',(str,list,tuple,dict)) - mulitple
11. for consecutive ele in list check list.py 
12. to get every nth value always go for for of n
13. iterating two things simultanously means zip()
14. iterating two things not simultanously means double for statement
15. when ever you want to add nested list itme in dict u need to use tuple always 
16. is and == diff imp
17. reassigning is very imp note that check list.py it has some very imp questions
18. enumeration is the key see if can be applied during index prop in slicing is also very helpful and keep a note blem
19. list mein hamesha yaad rkhna when iterating in for loop keep brain wide open
20. bonus tip always try to create intermediate list or dic, or even string's and then add it to the final open
21. any question regarding index always go for enum or range(len(lt))
22. so the hack here is always go for range(len(lt)) or enum during index problem's
23. if lt or if not lt
24. using step option it.
25. for _ in range() is also imp keep in mind to use it please.
26. imp thing to note is string ka concept.
27. imp to note in list when there is a question for split list always go for split logic and always note: step optin is really imp.
28. remeber None keyword also is useful.
29. another useful note when step is invloved in for loop then i will be respect to step but i+1 is just 1 increment
30. None is a special case single object hence we can directly use "is None or is not None".
31. to get transpose matrix of 2d list go for """for i in zip(*lt)"""
32. lt = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
note here above 1,4,7 are col 1 and 2,5,8 are col 2 and last is col 3
33. row = len(lt) in above col is len(lt[0])
34. imp thing to note is 2d list can not be input for set.
35. also imp note is that floor and ceil are in math module.
36. iter() can help it is really important keep a note of it.
37. sum(1 for i in lt) -> very imp in case of getting count/freq
38. enum method can take any iterators.
39. remeber you can use else with for also - 
/////////////
for i in s:
    if i in lt.keys():
        print(i)
        break
else:
    print(None)   - also note when wrtiting func we can directly use return no need else.
/////////////

/////////////
always remeber this kind of unpacking
lt = [((1,2),'deep'),((4,5),'ghetia')]

for (i,j),k in lt:
    print(i,j,k)
/////////////
40. use of map is really helpful always remeber.
41. use of reduce - 
from functools import reduce
lt = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(reduce(lambda x,y: x if x>y else y , lt)) 

42. break is imp note the wordings break has to be added then and there it self.
43. strictly remeber never use same cont in single if else block it is really imp to note this - 
classic example this one - 
lt = [3,10,4,7,5,7,8,3,3,4,5,9,3,4,9,8,5]
count = 0
deep = []
for i in lt:
    if i%2==0:
        count+=1
    if i%2!=0:
        deep.append(i)
    elif count > 4 and i%2==0:
        deep.append(i)
print(deep)

45. all the subsets que
from itertools import combinations

lt = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
summ = 10
final = [list(combinations(lt,i)) for i in range(len(lt)+1)]
print([(i) for i in [j for i in final for j in i] if sum(i)==summ])

46. remeber this logic - 
lt = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
k = 3
final = [lt[i:i+k] for i in range(0,len(lt),k)]
print(final)

47.for i in range(len(lt)):
    for j in range(i+1,len(lt)+1):
        print(lt[i:j])

48. for i in range(len(lt)):
    for j in range(i+1,len(lt)):
        final.append([lt[i],lt[j]])
        
49. for i in range(len(lt)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(lt)):
        for m in range(j+1, len(lt)):
            result.append([lt[i], lt[j], lt[m]])

49.
lt_index = [0,1,2,3,4....]
reverse_lt_index = [....-4,-3,-2,-1]

when choosing reverse move from behind to beg and -1
when moving from beg to end be it in neg or pos way you get slicing
