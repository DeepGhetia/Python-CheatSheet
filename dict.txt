1. always note list(i) where i is dict gives only key values in list similar to waht list(i.keys()) does.
2. # Valid keys
    d = {
        "name": "Alice",
        42: "Answer",
        (1, 2): "Tuple Key",
        True: "Boolean Key",
        frozenset([1, 2, 3]): "Frozen Set Key"
    } #invalid types: list, set, dict
3. copy - dic1 = dict(dic)
4. concat dict = "|"
5. del dic['a] -> to delete key and value
6. always try to keep in mind to use the list or tuples when multiple dic's are present. - refer dict.py
7. jab tum pura ek sath dic dekh sakte hon then y go for for loop.
8. always keep mind and eyes wide open dont over complex the logic.
9. list(dict) is the new normal.
10. always remeber when iterating key and values together to check ame elements always go for for -> for loop (double for loop).
11. remeber this line when you are adding the var of some dic to same var then try this kind of logic. 
val = dic['Carla ']
print(val)
for i in range(1,len(lt)):
    val = val[lt[i]]
12. always note 
    say i have t = ('deep',1)
    print(dict(t))
    here this is not going to work as len of tuple is 2 always note for something to be cnverted to dict the len should always be 1 with 2 elements.
    ideally like this t = [('deep',1)]
13. one of the very good questions - https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/list/python-data-type-list-exercise-94.php
this example shows tuple and dic bahi bhai.
